Analyzing Triangle Size Distribution in a Simple Cellular Automata

Run the program with:
$ python3 simple_ca.py

Plot the distribution with:
$ ./plot.sh

Running the program will automatically generate the datafiles
simple_distibution.dat and surface.dat 

These files can be made into a plot using the corresponding 
gnuplot script found in the “gnuplot” folder.  

The script “plot.sh” runs both gnuplot scripts and then opens
the output png images.
